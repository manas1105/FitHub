FitHub is a web-based platform designed to offer a complete fitness and wellness experience online. The system consists of several integrated modules that work together to deliver personalized fitness, nutrition, and mental wellness services to users.

The platform is built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, responsiveness, and ease of use. Users can register on the platform, create their personal profiles, set fitness goals, and receive customized workout and diet plans based on their preferences and body metrics. Progress can be tracked through interactive dashboards and visual charts.

FitHub also includes a mental wellness component, offering meditation guides, stress-relief exercises, and motivational content to support users' mental health. Additionally, the system facilitates interaction with certified trainers and nutritionists through chat or virtual sessions.

A community feature allows users to connect, share progress, ask questions, and encourage each other â€” creating a motivating and engaging environment. The platform encourages user participation, helping users stay consistent and motivated.

The backend of the system handles user management, content delivery, plan generation, and communication, while the frontend ensures a smooth and interactive user experience across devices. The system also integrates with wearable devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches to provide real-time data synchronization for a more accurate progress report.
